Hi, my name is Eli Orzitzer and I live in Israel.

Early Days
----------

My father bought the first computer when I was at the age of 6.  
I always enjoyed exploring (hacking...) and understanding things and I still remember the joy of:  
Finding the new concept of directories for copying the [IM2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Mission_II) game in DOS 3.  
Hacking Supaplex in order to jump levels (by changing the level char to ASCII smily (no. 1) in the saved games file).  
Setting the save games file of Gobliiins 3 to read only and then taking the hint - to not loose the hint count.

I started programming at the age of 10 with the internal ROM-BASIC of my original IBM-PC (1.7Mhz) which evolved and included:
* writing an assembly method to enable mouse support for QBASIC (that won a prize of one of the newspapers in my country)
* writing a TSR DOS util to switch from VGA graphic mode to text mode to allow running the dictionary program and play adventure games.
* several utils (some even got sold) and more...

Noadays

Later on, I took my hobby and made it a profession Learned B.Sc. in in computer science and started working.

Currently, I am working with Scala always looking to learn something new.
