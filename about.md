Early Days
----------
Hi, my name is Eli Orzitzer and I live in Israel.
My father bought the first computer when I was at the age of 6. I always enjoyed understanding things to the end which allowed my to do some nice hacking like:
I still remember the joy of finding the new concept of directories for copying the [IM2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impossible_Mission_II) game in DOS 3 
Allowing me to jump the levels in Supaplex by changing the level char to ASCII smily (no. 1).
Set the save games file of Gobliiins 3 to read only and then taking the hint - to not loose the hint count.

I started programming at the age of 10 with the internal ROM-BASIC of my original IBM-PC (1.7Mhz) which evolved and included doing:
* wroting and assembly method to enable mouse support for QBASIC (that won a prize of one of the newspapers in my country)
* wrote a TSR DOS util to switch from VGA graphic mode to text mode to allow running the dictionary program and play adventure games.
* several utils (some even got sold) and more...

Later on, I took my hobby and made it a profession Learned B.Sc. in in computer science and started working.

Currently, I am working with Scala always looking to learn something new.
